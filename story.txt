  Beginning:
  There once was a man named Jim. Jim enjoyed many things, but his favorite thing in the world was singing. 
  Jim would stay up late singing in his room and he'd sing in the shower early the next morning. All Jim
  ever needed in life was to be able to sing. However, one day Jim got a nasty cold that made it so he couldn't
  sing anymore.
  Middle:
  Jim was straight up devastated. He spent all his time singing, and suddenly now he had a lot of free time.
  Jim thought really hard about what he should do. He decided to go see a doctor to see if he could ever 
  restore his singing ability.
  
  End:
